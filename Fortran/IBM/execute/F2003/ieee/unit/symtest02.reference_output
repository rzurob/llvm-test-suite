 The FE set the IEEE_FPSCR bit on xx, yy, and _main
 zz does not have the bit set.
 The IO library functions also have the bit set.

 val() = (/ overflow, dbz, invalid, underflow, inexact
  
 If there are errors, they will appear below:
 Fail - div_by_zero should be clear
 Fail - val( 1 ) is not  T
 Fail - val( 2 ) is not  T
 Fail - rounding mode changed
