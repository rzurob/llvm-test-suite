Feature: 289079 - Allocatable Assignment Enhancements - Reallocation of an
         allocatable left-hand side of an intrinsic assignment where necessary

Test cases:

ReallocAssignArray[xy] 
    Testing reallocation of allocatable arrays that are not of character type
    or derived type.

ReallocAssignArrayCharacter[xy]
    Testing reallocation of allocatable character arrays, with lengths that
    are assumed, deferred, known at run time, and known at compile time.

ReallocAssignArrayDT[xy]
    Testing reallocation of allocatable derived-type arrays.  Testing involves
    finalization, as well as derived types with type parameters.  Type parameter
    testing in these unit tests is very limited.

ReallocAssignScalarCharacter[xy]
    Testing reallocation of allocatable deferred-length character scalars.

ReallocAssignScalarDT[xy]
    Testing reallocation of allocatable derived-type scalars with deferred
    length type parameters.  These unit tests are very limited.
