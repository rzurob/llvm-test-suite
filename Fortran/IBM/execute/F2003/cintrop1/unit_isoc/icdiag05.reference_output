"icdiag05.f", line 48.19: 1518-395 (L) Argument a to the intrinsic procedure C_LOC does not have interoperable type and type parameters. a must be a scalar nonpolymorphic variable with no length type parameters by the Fortran 2003 standard.
"icdiag05.f", line 48.19: 1518-407 (L) The actual argument to the C_LOC intrinsic procedure is of type character.  The length type parameter of the argument is required to be interoperable with a C type by the Fortran 2003 standard.
