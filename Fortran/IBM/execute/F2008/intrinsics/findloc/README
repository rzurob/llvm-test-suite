RTC Story 44833: F2008: FINDLOC Transformational Intrinsic Function

FINDLOC is a TIF that finds the location of a specific value in an array.
It is described in the Fortran 2008 standard under section 13.7.61.

Unit tests are located @:
./unit_tests/diag
./unit_tests/func

The I0 can be found in ./doc subdirectory.
This was a unit tests-only feature, so there is not IT1 or IT2.
