Feature 381018 F2008: Constant expression as stop code in STOP statement

Here STOP statement means STOP and ERROR STOP statments.

In Fortran 2008 the STOP statement has been updated and in addition to accepting a sequence of digits and a scalar character constant as the stop code now it also supports an integer or a character constant expression. This directory contains the testcases for testing these new additions to the STOP and ERROR STOP statements.

Unit tests are located @:
./unit_tests/diag
./unit_tests/func

CAF tests are located @:
../coarray/stop/const_expr/unit
../coarray/stop/const_expr
../coarray/error_stop/const_expr

The design documents, I0, IT1 and IT2, can be found in ./doc subdirectory.
