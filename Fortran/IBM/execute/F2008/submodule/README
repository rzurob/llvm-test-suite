This directory contains both submodule and module subprogram test cases.

It is structured such that the func, diag, and unit_test folders in this
directory contain the submodule test cases.

Module subprogram test cases were checked in as a subfolder in this directory
and were mostly produced by porting the submodule test cases.  The directory
structure mirrors the submodule directory structure. 

Some diagnostic tests were not ported as they would not be unique to module
subprograms.  Only the test cases added for module subprogram are listed
in its IT2.  Other test cases are similar to those listed in the submodule
IT2.


While fixing defect RTC defect 58891, Daniel discovered some severe limitations
to the design and created more unit test cases, which are checked into the
unit_tests directory in the submodule folder.

This also prompted a second phase to develop new module subprogram test cases
to enhance coverage.  These test cases are to be listed in the IT1/2 documents,
but no new review was created.
