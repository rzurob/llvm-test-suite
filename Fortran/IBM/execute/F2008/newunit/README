Feature 344377 F2008: Fortran 2008 adds the NEWUNIT= specifier to the OPEN statement. The NEWUNIT= specifier avoids accidental changes to currently connected units by asking the Fortran runtime library to make a connection to an unused unit, and assign that unit's number to the variable specified in the NEWUNIT= specifier. The unit number selected by the runtime library is always negative and does not interfere with unit numbers selected by the user program.

unit/diag tests are located :
