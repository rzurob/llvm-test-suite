Overview

Coarray scalars (sometimes referred to by the team as "coscalars") can be passed in as arguments to procedures. This feature deals only with intrinsic types, avoiding some of the more involved issues of connected with derived types (especially polymorphism).

Test Strategy

A number of tests already exist for coarray dummy arguments which are arrays of explicit or assumed size (F2008/coarray/coarray_dummy/explicit_shape and F2008/coarray/coarray_dummy/assumed_size). Access to scalars and to arrays is similar enough that these can be adapted simply by removing array indexing. Some such cases will be uninteresting variations on one another, once the indexing is removed, so, to avoid duplication, only some of these will be taken into the final collection.

In addition, there is a test for storage association: an array element is passed in as a scalar to a procedure expecting an array, which then accesses the actual argument as if the array element passed in were the first element in the array.

Test Procedures/Scenarios

Name 	Description
cdasBasic 	access only, same bounds in actual and dummy

cdasBasicSet 	set only
cdasCodimensionChg 	different codimensions, but same corank
cdasCorankChg 	corank is different
cdasModule 	coarray variables from a module
cdasMultiple 	multiple images
cdasStgAssoc 	storage association
cdas_d380692 	multiple images
