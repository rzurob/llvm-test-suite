Test cases under this directory came from Rice University.  While we have
obtained the necessary permissions and IBM Legal approval to use these test
cases in our suites, the test cases are non-distributable and must not be
used in external demos.

A copy of IBM Legal's approval of the inclusion of the test cases is in
the XLF Teamroom.  It can be found at the following link:
